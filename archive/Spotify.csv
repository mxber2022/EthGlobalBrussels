The personal mixes really feel personal and all of the daily mixes makes sense to my moods at least. I love the yearly wrapped and I love spotify's custom playlists for different music genres.

Having to listen to a song fully as I can't even skip the song if I am in the mood of something different. 2. Can't check lyrics. 3. Can't play specific parts of a song. 4.

And even the app without premium isn't as good as it used to be. A limit on the amount of lyrics you can look at is unnecessary we can just look them up on google.

My main issue is a song will stop playing in the middle or the sound will cut off, even though my volume is all the way at maximum and the signal is good on my phone. I also can't log in on the mobile website if the app isn't working. Very frustrating as my playlist is pretty much all I listen to for music these days. Premium isn't in my budget either. Update: Reinstalling the app helped, it's working again. Thank you!",5

What can use major work is the algorithm the app uses to put together a 'song radio' or 'similar music' list. A song radio criteria filter may be helpful to get closer to what listeners are looking for. Example: I can start a song radio list for a country music song by Kenny Rogers, but am I looking for songs that sound like it, the same genre, the same artist, classic country, Pop country?",4

It's a good music app but the having to pay to see lyrics is very ridiculous. And why do you add songs to my playlist? They're not in it for a reason.

I would like a button that literally just shuffles the order of my playlist. Now the app is forcing me off my playlist for one song! Then when I hide it the song still forces me out of my playlist.

Spotify can create a blend for 10 people ( that's a lot ) 2. To be honest, the ads are never too much, unlike some other apps where you get an ad after every 1 song. 3. It can play music in the background. 4. It also automatically starts a song if the song which you chose to play is done playing. Conclusion : I highly recommend this app",5
