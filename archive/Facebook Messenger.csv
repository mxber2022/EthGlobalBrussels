dc86f013-03fb-4f50-8232-06fec4ccae5f,The new friend suggestion sucks. It is showing instead of the messages. Show the messages itself. This app is not the facebook app. Also new friend stories are takes a while to update or not loading at all as new stories. Remove the friend suggestion. Display previous messages like it is supposed to do. Also bring back the sent/delivered check box. It's a lot easier to know from the side of the sender if the message is sent/delivered without opening the chat itself.,3

I don't know if it's just me, but mostly of my messages are left on ""sending"" even tho I have a stable internet connection, and my ""sending messages"" will dissappear after I restart my internet connection and go back to messenger.

It's a shame but T-Mobile still $121.65 for me a few days ago and they told me to wait till today they would call me but nobody at T-Mobile seems to not had a dial a phone and make a phone call so they can all go to hell if the dying horribly in a fire would be okay with me. T-Mobile or thieves and they belong in jail. And I'm not crazy about this app either,2

4d2524c1-fd22-43d6-8536-e0024c7cdb4f,Unreliable. Group chats are one of the worst experiences of any app that I've ever used. The most frustrating thing is the fact that over 90% of videos or images or any media of any type fail to send. For videos if it fails at least you get a fail notice but for pictures if it fails you have no clue. They're supposed to be a little check mark the lower right but the moment it fulfills it disappears and when that happens that usually tells me it didn't send. Absolutely trash at just like Facebook,1

The text box disappears when typing so I can't see what I send or amend it etc. I don't even get notification sounds for new messages anymore. Update: I can no longer use the search function within a message to find an old message of where they told me their address or kids birthday or recipe etc. So reduced to 2 star rating.,2

69a6b111-a825-4f97-9324-c46f9d4f4069,The update sucks! The end to end encryption is the worst update! Once you forgot your pin you're screwed! It's almost impossible to restore your messages! You cannot view and send images due to bugs! I have to reinstall the app. Some messages won't send even if you have stable internet connection. Devs are focusing on monetizing the app but the service is getting worse!,1

The representative from Premier, Robert Halsne, was very helpful in the process. I am located in Southern California, and when I first contacted him, he guided me the whole way through the process with no problems and made it a pleasant experience. When I went to Portland to pick up the truck, I was greeted with warm sin cerity and honesty. I believe I have made new friends at Premier.",5

Also messages received and sent disappear at random and cannot be located by either party. (I know there is a setting where they can be set to disappear after a time. But they are not set to disappear in my settings).,1

b5620524-fdbf-4919-83de-6c3111277d50,I was on flight HB0282 from Bkk to HK on 07 July 24. It's was the best experience as a budget airlines. I was never so well taken care of with some other budget airlines. Flight attendance was Gucci and Bella. I was well informed about the food that I am going to order. Explained to me very clearly about 4 airlines provided in HK. Both of them are very polite & helpful. I think HK needs more services peoples like them. I have shared in my buddies whatapps group too.,5

Człowiek chce znaleźć jakąś ważna informacje co była trochę dawniej pisana to nie da rady bo nie wyszukuje jej wcale. Przy zdjęciach i filmikach zaś nie pokazuje kto i kiedy wysłał czyniąc szukanie o wiele cięższym. Aplikacja sama w sobie często źle pokazuje, na które wiadomości ktoś odpowiedział i scrolluje wręcz za daleko. Gdyby nie bliscy to dawno bym usunęła tą aplikację.",1

This app doesn't help matters any simply because it autosends whatever I mistakenly touch. Then I have to unsend it. And it just plain removes my motivation to send anything. Why look for a sticker or a gif that fits what I'm trying to say when I have to remove 2 or 3 to do it... Edit: Now it can't send pictures... Why even use it anymore.,1
